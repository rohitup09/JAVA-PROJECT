README : JAVA PROJECT

This project has been developed by Rohit Upadhyay, V S Lavan, and G Niveditha in March/April, 2023. It is a Java Swing based e-commerce site with login and shopping cart functionalities. The functions are linked with a MySQL database through JDBC.

When attempting to execute this project from your own system, please note the following:

1) The credentials for the MySQL local server, including username and password may be different on your application, and the Java code must be altered according to the same.

2) The file paths for the images will need to b changed, as right now they are the local file paths on our personal system.

Thank you for exploring our project!
